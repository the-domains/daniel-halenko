How a hug a day can increase profitability

Before I begin, a quick caveat which I feel is appropriate... I'm not saying go round hugging people in your office. Well, I am, but like anything, it has to be within context.

The reality is everyone likes a hug, and those that don't, have probably never had one for a while, forgot what's its like or have conditioned themselves to say they 'just don't like them. fact is we are brought up to hug, children hug things naturally and all research shows that hugging releases oxytocin, the same chemical that rushes through a woman when she gives birth gives birth, there's a host of documentaries and ted talks all about oxytocin and hugs if you want to research that more.anyway, i'd love to write an article all about why we should all hug more, but don't want that to come across as too tree hugging at this stage, seeing as we've only just met.What I can talk about is hugging in the work place.  I can relate to both and i'm sure you can relate to at least the work place. The one things that is NOT huggist is oxytocin.  It doesn't care where you hug or what type of hug it is, when it happens it is released.

Lets ignore the HUGE positive ramifications any team could have that generally feels love more and is happier, and focus on some logic instead thats easier to visualise.

Any group of friends who are comfortable enough to hug one another, male or female (yes men, we  hug), will share a closer bond to those who don't.  As each barrier breaks between two people (physical ones like hugging and mental ones like sharing something they normally wouldn't) they get to know one another better and so interact with each other at a deeper level.Any team in any business is just like a group of friends.  Different personalities, suited to different tasks, and they are trying to complete something together.  Creating a culture where it is either acceptable to hug (ie others don't find it weird) or where people actually hug, will allow that team to grow as people and a team.

We are all people at the end of the day, just that sometimes as people we have to work in these artificially created environments called work spaces.  In these spaces we are told how to behave ourselves (something as humans throughout all civilisation we have had difficulty in doing) and what is acceptable and isn't etc.  In many work spaces, there is no room for freedom, creativity or expression.  And so with each day we become less and less like humans, and more like robots, which is no surprise why people lose interest in their job or their lives and why all of a sudden there are 'mid life crisis's".  Im sure early man or even man in 1900's didn't ask themselves later in life is this it and go out and buy horse and cart to show off!

Back to hugs.  They may not be much to look at, but if you can nurture a work space which can allow a hug to take place (its like human biology in the making) then you can create a team which is more collaborative than before, communicates better and cares more.I've read umpteen books that relate to business and if there's one thing is good.Increased communicationIncreased collaborationIncreased overall caringIs how one hug a day, can increase profitability
